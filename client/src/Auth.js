// Understand that Auth is merely a protocol: It will look slightly different
// for every project. This worked decently for us, but there are likely bugs we
// didn't catch.

// The basic idea is to import this object in each file where
// authentication needs to happen. The client can also "remember" the
// user (like a session) by saving this object to local storage. It
// does not currently do this.
